# NBICreator

NBICreator is a NetBoot set creation tool written in Objective-C.

Currently it supports the following NetBoot sets:
* NetInstall
* DeployStudio
* Imagr

The design and idea of the application is to be able to create different types of NetBoot sets in one single application, and to save the configuration in a template to be reused when the NetBoot set need to be updated for newer versions of the OS.

# Important

This project is currently considered to be in alpha stage, so major changes will occur between builds that may break previously saved templates for example.

The code will also see major changes as some parts is being restructured.

# System Requirements

NBICreator requires Mac OS X 10.10 or newer.
