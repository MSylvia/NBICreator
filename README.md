# NBICreator

NBICreator is a NetInstall Image creation tool written in Objective-C.

Currently it supports the following NetBoot sets:
* NetInstall
* DeployStudio
* Imagr

The design and idea of the application is to be able to create different types of NetBoot sets in one single application, and to allow an administrator to save the confiuration in a template to be reused when the NetBoot set need to be updated for newer versions of the OS.

# System Requirements

NBICreator requires Mac OS X 10.10 or newer.
